# NSTU_E_medical_Center
The project will provide a digital platform for doctors and patients to access medical services, information, and communication channels online, eliminating the need for manual processes. The web application will include a doctor profile system, allowing doctors to create their profiles and write prescriptions online, which can be sent to patients as PDF files via email. The system will also have a patient information database, allowing the medical center to maintain patient records with unique IDs for easy access to their medical history. The project also aims to provide a patient feedback system, enabling patients to rate and comment on the quality of treatment they received. The medical center can use this system to monitor the quality of its services and make improvements where necessary. 

Moreover, the web application will offer a chat option, providing patients with the ability to receive online consultations from doctors without physically visiting the medical center. The website will also have a blog post option, where doctors can share articles on medical topics like first aid and other health issues. Finally, the web application will feature a medical accountant system, allowing the medical center to track the inflow and outflow of medicine, as well as maintain records of the types of medicine used by patients. Overall, this project aims to digitize the medical center at NSTU and provide a more convenient and efficient way for doctors and patients to access and manage medical services. The project will enable the medical center to provide better patient care, track medicine inflow and outflow, and maintain records of patient information, ultimately improving the quality of medical services provided by the center.
